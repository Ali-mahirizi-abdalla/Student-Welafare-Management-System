# Campus Care: Student Welfare Management System (HMS)

## Vision
To transform university living into a nurturing environment through unified digital care, ensuring every student's well-being is prioritized through accessible, efficient, and transparent management.

## 🚩 The Problem: The "Silent Struggle" on Campus
Welfare management in large institutions often fails because student needs are treated as numbers rather than individuals.

1.  **Neglected Individual Needs**: Students with disabilities (PWD) or chronic conditions often have their specific housing needs overlooked due to paper-based, non-inclusive registration.
2.  **The Maintenance Gap**: Delays in fixing essential services (water, electricity, sanitation) create environments that are unfit for studying, directly impacting student mental health and performance.
3.  **Nutrition Blind Spots**: Without meal tracking, universities cannot ensure that all students are being fed or predict resource needs, leading to waste or shortages in essential nutrition.
4.  **Financial Accessibility Barriers**: Complex, rigid payment cycles for accommodation create unnecessary stress for students and parents.
5.  **Reactive Safety Protocols**: Relying on manual visitor books and antiquated reporting systems means safety issues are only addressed *after* they happen.

## 💡 The Solution: Campus Care
A proactive welfare ecosystem that bridges the gap between students and administration through real-time care coordination.

### 1. Inclusive Personalization (Care First)
*   **PWD-Prioritized Registration**: Dedicated fields for disability details to ensure students are assigned to accessible rooms and receive necessary support from Day 1.
*   **Dynamic Student Profiles**: Comprehensive data that follows the student, ensuring their welfare history (maintenance needs, status changes) is always visible to authorized caregivers.

### 2. Proactive Living Standards
*   **Rapid Maintenance Portal**: Instant reporting and transparent tracking of repair requests to maintain a high standard of student living conditions.
*   **Emergency Communication**: A dedicated chat system that provides a direct line to welfare officers for inquiries or urgent assistance.

### 3. Nutrition & Wellness Management
*   **Smart Meal Confirmation**: A digital gateway for students to confirm meal attendance, ensuring accurate resource planning and guaranteed nutrition for every student on the program.
*   **Early/Away Modes**: Allows students to manage their meal status (e.g., away for research, early breakfast) without administrative friction.

### 4. Campus Safety & Security
*   **Modern Visitor Management**: Digitally categorized visitor logs (Parents, Students, PWD) with instant check-in/out to ensure a secure campus environment.
*   **Lost & Found Integration**: A centralized, community-driven board to quickly reunite students with their belongings, reducing the stress of misplaced items.

### 5. Transparent & Flexible Financing
*   **Semester-Based Payments**: Aligns housing costs with the academic calendar to simplify financial planning for families.
*   **Integrated M-Pesa Portal**: Instant, secure payment processing with immediate confirmation, reducing the burden of manual receipts.
